## Introduction 

My latest goal is to run every single trail of the Santa Monica Mountains (EST SMM).
This is inspired by Rickey Gates' project: [Every Single Street](https://www.everysinglestreet.com/), in which he ran every road in San Francisco.
My life has improved dramatically since I started running in October 2019 in Gothenburg, Sweden.
I had been a boulder for a few years but had stagnated and lost a lot of my motivation.
Running brought an entirely new mental clarity that helped me through the COVID-19 pandemic.
Being an extremely habitual person, I had my set routes for various distances that I would do.
I didn't do much exploring and did the same 5k, 10k, 15km, half-marathon routes all the time.
This was extremely helpful for training purposes since I would just move on autopilot through the routes.
Looking back now though I wish I had explored more on my runs.
I also took for granted the amazing bike routes in Sweden.

Now I have moved back to LA, where I spent the first 25 years of my life.
I continued running but stuck to areas around West LA and not doing too much exploring.
After too much volume, I ended up with a stress fracture on my foot and had to rest.
I ordered a cheap road bike online on a whim to stay in shape.
Little did I know how much it would change my life.
A few weeks after I started biking, I ended up doing my first 100km (62.14 miles) ride in Yosemite Valley of all places.

I got addicted to longer rides and kept pushing the distance further every weekend with rides before work most mornings.
My biggest highlights in terms of distance were back-to-back 100 mile (161km) rides and a 200km ride around the Santa Monica Mountains and through the canyons.
All of this was over about 6 weeks, which may have been a bit extreme to start with.
I started using [VeloViewer](https://veloviewer.com/) and [Stats Hunters](https://www.statshunters.com/) to collect "tiles" on the map.
This ignited a sense of exploration in me and I decided to not only collect all the tiles of the SMMs but to ride to and run every trail of the SMMs.

This is an entirely exploration oriented goal: no finish times, no date to finish by, no strict rules.
I'm hoping to culminate the project in a single ultra-run of the entire (109.10 km/67.79 miles) Backbone Trail with 3,924m/12,874ft elevation gain.

## Loose Rules
  - Run/hike/walk all trails of the Santa Monica Mountains (*)
  - Self-propel to the trail heads as much as possible.
  - Take pictures of every trail.
  - Document each of the days.
  - Don't get injured

(*) "All trails" is essentially just the trails/fireroads that I can find on either All Trails/Gaia GPS/Stats Hunter/VeloViewer/Google Maps/Strava.
