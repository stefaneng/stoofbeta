Wonder why the street is called Los Liones and the trail head is called Los Leones... I'll call it Los Leones to have the correct spanish spelling.

This was a bit of an interesting day. I was planning on doing a trail in Malibu somewhere but ended up getting a flat around the Getty Vila.
I couldn't get my pump to work on my bike so I checked what the closest trail was to me.
I decided to walk my bike up to Los Leones. Since the Getty Vila is closed due to COVID-19 I had to walk up through Castellammare.
Lots of steps to carry my bike up!
After about 3km of walking from the PCH I locked up bike up and started to run/hike up the trail at Los Leones.

There is one main trail that follows a single-track up to the East Topanga fireroad.
The alternative way up is a steep, more direct, way.
Alltrails refers to it as [El Ocaso Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/parker-mesa-overlook-via-el-ocaso-trail-rabbit-hole)

I would have been able to kill two birds with one stone if I had gone up El Ocaso Trail and down East Topanga fire road.
I'll have to go back to El Ocaso another day to check if off the list.
Overall the main trail was nice but can get quite congested on the single-track since it is a popular area.
