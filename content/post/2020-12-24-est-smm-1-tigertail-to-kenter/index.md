First run on my goal to run all of the trails in the Santa Monica Mountains (EST SMM). [See the post here](/2021/01/08/every-single-trail-santa-monica-mountains-est-smm/) for more background on the challnge.

Felt like I was back in Gothenburg today with the wind and the rain.
It was pretty much the first weather we have had since I got back.
Beautiful views out even with the rain.
This is one of the nicest views of Mt. Saint Mary's.

This is exactly the kind of trail I wanted to find with this challenge.
A super unpopular, burnt, steep and loose trail in between more popular ones.

Really steep up and downhills so it was mostly hiking.
There were a couple of steep hills ([up to 28% grade?](https://www.strava.com/segments/26661208)).
I turned around at the hill before Canyon Back Trail.

Great start to the journey.
