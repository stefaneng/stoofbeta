This is definitely a trail I would not have done without this challenge.
I had never been to Mt Saint Mary's, but saw that there was a trail/fire road that started from the campus.

I rode over here during my lunch break to check it out.
To get to the trail you have to check in with the guard at the campus.
Since the campus is closed due to COVID-19, there was practically no one here.
I locked my bike up to the gate at the fireroad right where a ton of bees were.
Luckily I didn't get stung.

There wasn't too much interesting about this trail itself, but the views this day were fantastic.
It had just rained and snowed in the mountains around LA.
The hilltops were covered with snow and you could see down to Long Beach.

There was also great views of the water and of the canyon

Following the fireroad up leads to a split to continue on the fireroad, or down the Riordan Trail.
I continued on the fireroad until I reached a locked gate at Stoney Hill Road.
Then I doubled back and went down the Riordan Trail.

I saw on google maps that there was a trail cutting up the mountain side.
Trail ended up being an exaggeration!
Check out the [segment of the scramble here](https://www.strava.com/segments/26847158).
It was loose scrambling getting back up to the fireroad.

It was fun to explore something new. Never would have gone here if it weren't for this challenge.
