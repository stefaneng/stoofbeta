After work today I rode over to Sullivan Canyon trail.
I had been here once before with my girlfriend but we didn't hike very far.
It is reasonably close by so I figured it was a good one to do in the evening.
Based on google maps it looked like I could go up from Old Ranch Rd, but of course it is a private road.

The trail is fairly flat and pretty rocky with some weird square cement pieces.
You have to stay focused to not step on some of the bigger rocks.
Looked like fall with all the orange leaves on the ground.
I guess January in LA is practically fall weather.

The first couple of miles were kind of a slog but got into it after a while.
Today I incorporated some eating practice so I ate 6 dried figs and some homemade pinole cookies.
I also drank way more water than I needed.
This is based on some reading I did in the paper: [Training the Gut for Athletes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5371619/).
We will see how that goes as I work on it.
Today it resulted in a bathroom run off the trail.

I continued to the Sullivan Spur trail and turned around there because it got pretty loose and it was quite dark at this point. I didn't really feel like descending that in the dark.
Next time I'll probably do Sullivan Fire Road and finish up this little loop.

I ran most of the trail in zone 2 (~ 120-135 bpm) and finished up the paved hill pushing pretty hard.
I continued up the neighborhood a bit since it felt so good to be running harder up the hill.
After the run I ate a few more cookies and put on my Noxgear Tracer360 vest and rode down the hill and back home for a big dinner.
