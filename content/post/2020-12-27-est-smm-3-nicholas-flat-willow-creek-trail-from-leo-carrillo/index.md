This was my first trail on the challenge that had a longer bike ride.
I started the bike ride out to Leo Carillo around 6:30am.
Around 50km took about 2 hours along PCH.
It was an overcast day which turned out to be quite nice since there was no shade on the trail.

The Leo Carillo campground is closed due to COVID-19, so there was practically no one there.
I locked my bike up, had a bit to eat (one of my homemade pinole cookies and some figs) and headed up the Nicholas Flat Trail.
The trail starts off fairly steep and then comes to a flatter area around 4km.
Then the trail loops around to a little pond.
It seemed like the trail continued, on the map it looks like it was called the Nicholas Ridge Motorway.
I'll have to go back and do that section later.
The views were spectacular even with it being overcast.
It cleared up that you had a nice view of the water.
I only saw two other hikers on the trail.
I came down about the same way but went left on the Willow Creek Trail to finish.

When I got back to my bike I decided to ride a bit further up the coast.
I wanted to finish the Strava 1,250 km cycling challenge for the month so I rode up about 10km.
It took me a while to realize how fast I was going and that I had a super strong tailwind... which when I turned around was brutal to ride back in.
I had about 70km to get home... I only had 3 cookies left (maybe 250 kcals)... and a strong headwind.
My energy was fading fast so I had the rest of my food and felt good for a while.
With about 50km left to go I bonked super hard.
I guess the run took way more out of me than I was expecting.
Maybe it is bullheadedness but I have an aversion to stopping for food unless I really have to.
Bonking is just a consequence of not being prepared.
So my punishment was to ride the rest of the way home in a fugue state.
I hindsight, I really should have just stopped for some candy and a soda as it took forever to recover from this effort.
The views coming back were spectacular though and I wouldn't have rather been anywhere else.

Overall, the stats for the day were:

  - Biking: time 5:11, 125km/78 miles, 828m/2716ft gain
  - Run: time 1:35, 13.05km/8.1 miles, 686m/2250ft gain
